/**
 * @brief Calculates the maximum flow using the Improved Shortest Augmenting Path (ISAP) algorithm.
 * @note Time Complexity: O(V^2 * E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
 *       ISAP tends to be slightly faster than a standard Dinic implementation. It tends to have lower constant factors, avoids the overhead of repeated BFS phases, and its gap heuristic is highly effective. 
 *       Dinic has better proven complexity bounds on specific graph types, like unit capacity networks (O(min(V^(2/3), E^(1/2)) * E)).
 * @note Space Complexity: O(V + E) due to storing adjacency lists and level/gap arrays.
 *       In the worst case, O(E) for storing the edges.
 * 
 * @param s The source node.
 * @param t The sink node.
 * @return The maximum flow from s to t.
 *
 * @note This algorithm can be used for solving Directed Graph Maximum Weight Closure.
 *       Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph with weights w(v) on the vertices, where w(v) can be positive or negative.
 *       A closure of G is a subset of vertices C âŠ† V, such that for every vertex v in C, all of its successors are also in C.
 *       The weight of the closure is the sum of the weights of the vertices in it.
 *       The goal is to find the closure of maximum weight.
 *       This can be reduced to a min-cut problem (max-flow problem) as follows:
 *       1. Construct a new graph G' from G.
 *       2. Add a source node 's' and a sink node 't' to G'.
 *       3. For each vertex v in G:
 *          - If w(v) > 0, add an edge from 's' to v with capacity w(v).
 *          - If w(v) < 0, add an edge from v to 't' with capacity -w(v).
 *          - If w(v) = 0, no edges are added regarding the node weight.
 *       4. For each edge (u, v) in G, add an edge from u to v in G' with infinite capacity.
 *       5. Let W_pos be the sum of all positive w(v).
 *       6. Compute the maximum flow F from 's' to 't' in G'.
 *       7. The maximum closure weight is W_pos - F.
 *       8. The maximum weight closure is all the vertices that can be reachable from s, in the residual graph.
